# emoji_hilbert
Makes an emoji version of Hilbert’s curve and prints it to the console.

Today, I invented this emoji version of Hilbert’s curve and [posted it to Twitter](https://twitter.com/thiagovscoelho/status/1679609786105561088). Then, I spent a while [asking ChatGPT to make this code](https://thiago-gpt.blogspot.com/2023/07/the-making-of-emojihilbert.html), which it did not do on the first try, but did do eventually, after asking for it very slowly and step-by-step. Here are the results:

It literally goes on forever, or as much as your computer can do. I think that this is enough, though, it’s as much as fits on my monitor anyway without zooming out.
